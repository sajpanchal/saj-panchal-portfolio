            . Welcome to my personal web-site. First, I want to tell about
            myself in a brief summary. on this page, I have put all the personal
            information about me. I came to Canada from India about 4 years ago.
            I have been living in Waterloo since last 2 years and I love living
            in this awesome town.
          </p>
          <p className="biotext">
            Talking about my education, I finished my high school from
            <strong>
              <i> St. Xavierâ€™s Surat, Gujarat, India (year 2010) </i>
            </strong>
            . Then I went ahead to do engineering and I graduated from
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <i>SVIT college (part of GTU)</i>{" "}
            </strong>{" "}
            with
            <strong>
              <i>B.Eng. in Electronics and Communication (year 2014) </i>
            </strong>
            . After that, I wanted to go abroad to study further to do
            specialization in automation field. So, I applied to
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <i>Robotics and Industrial automation</i>
            </strong>{" "}
            program being delivered in{" "}
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <i>Conestoga college </i>
            </strong>{" "}
            which is a specialization program that provides hands-on learning.
          </p>
          <p className="biotext">
            After graduation, I was offered a job as a set-up technician at
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <em> Linamar Corp, Guelph, Ontario (year 2018)</em>{" "}
            </strong>
            . I was assigned to work in one of the production lines in the
            automation assembly plant. I was given a responsibility to monitor
            the production workers, machines, robots and the whole process of
            assembly of automotive parts. So, in general my work includes
            troubleshoot, recover, set-up the malfunctioning machines or robots,
            occasional preventive maintenance of various cells and daily
            production reporting to the production supervisor. I liked that job
            but I wanted to do something more creative and something in which I
            am more interested of.

            As I love coding and I previously demonstrated my ability to develop
            applications in various platforms such as Windows, IOS and HMI
            (automation systems) I chose to study in IT field. And, I came to
            know about the
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <i> Mobile solutions Development </i>
            </strong>
            program being delivered at Conestoga college campus which is nearby
            to location where I have been living. I found that program
            interesting as it was matching with most of the thing that I did in
            past and things in which I want to learn further. Now, my goal is to
            graduate from this program with high GPA and become an iOS developer
            or full-stack developer.

            Talking about my hobbies and interests, I love reading, watching
            cricket, listening to the music, and traveling. On top of all that,
            I like to help others and I love being independent. As of that, I
            work for Door Dash as a delivery driver which is a perfect platform
            for me to earn money and at the same time, a sort of opportunity to
            help people. Moreover, I work completely independent as I can choose
            at what time I want to work, where I want to work and for how many
            days and hours a week I want to work. It is as if I am my own boss.
